# Making a Time Converter

This issue will be a project that uses a slash command, modals, and block kits. Make an app that, when the right slash command is invoked, prompts the user for their timezone and hour and the timezone they would like to convert to. Afterwards, send them a message in the chat with the converted time. 

The shortcut should use selection menus for all of its fields. You should be able to convert from either timezone. You may also use any two timezones that you would like, and write any functions needed to convert from one to another. Refer to the following picture as a reference:

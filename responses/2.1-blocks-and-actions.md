# Block Kits and Actions

Block Kits are a more advanced way of sending messages through an app. In this issue, you will build an app that uses block kits. to interact with users. 



## Reading up

You will need to do some research on block kits in order to understand how they work. Read the following documentation for more guidance:

1. Making a stack of blocks: https://api.slack.com/block-kit/building
2. Interactivity in blocks: https://api.slack.com/block-kit/interactivity
3. Block types: https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks

### Actions

An action is a way to listen to events in Slack. Instead of listening for something that generally happens, you can listen for something that a user *does* in the workspace. Below is a basic example of an action:

```javascript
app.action('<event_id>', async ({ body, ack, <any other functions>}) => {
  // Acknowledge the action
  await ack();
});
```

One thing you **always** have to do in an action is aknowledge that the event occurred. Afterwards, you can use the payload from the action for your own purposes.

 

## Building Your App

Now it's time to make a block kit yourself! Your goal will be to write an app that will listen for the word 'hello' in a workspace's channels, then respond in the same channel announcing that who person said hello. The message should include a block kit with a button saying 'click me'. If someone clicks the button, then the app announces that a person clicked the button in a regular message.

Refer to the links above and this example of a block kit in a function call:

```json
await say({
	"blocks": [
		{
			"type": "section",
			"text": {
				"type": "plain_text",
				"text": "This is a plain text section block.",
				"emoji": true
			}
		}
	]
});
```



> **Hint**: Note in the template that a block can have an event id. This means that you can listen for events within the block (i.e. a button being clicked)
